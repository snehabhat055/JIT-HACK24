# JIT-HACK24

Efficient Parkinson's episode prediction system based on Alpha synuclein with AI driven approach:-

Developing an AI model to process the chemical biomarkers : alpha_synuclin . Collected from iot devices for training a model to predict an off-episodes in an advance. This system will also send notifications to patients, caregivers, and doctors while ensuring data security and facilitating research efforts.
